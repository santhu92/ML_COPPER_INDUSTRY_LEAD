#ML Model README
This README file provides an overview of the ML model project for the copper industry.

# ML_COPPER_INDUSTRY_LEAD
Industrial Copper Modeling, The copper industry deals with less complex data related to sales and pricing. 

#Problem Statement
The copper industry deals with sales and pricing data that may suffer from issues such as skewness and noisy data. The objective of this project is to develop machine learning models to address these challenges and achieve accurate predictions. The specific tasks include:

Regression Model: Build a regression model to predict the continuous variable 'Selling_Price' based on the provided dataset. Handle issues such as skewness, outliers, and missing values during preprocessing.

Classification Model: Construct a classification model to predict the lead status (WON or LOST) based on the available dataset. Clean the data by removing data points with statuses other than WON or LOST.

Streamlit GUI: Create an interactive web page using the Streamlit module where users can input values for each column (except 'Selling_Price' for regression and 'Status' for classification) and obtain predicted values for 'Selling_Price' or 'Status' accordingly. Implement necessary preprocessing steps, feature scaling, and transformations for the input data in the Streamlit app.

#Approach
Data Understanding: Identify the types of variables (continuous, categorical) and their distributions. Clean the data by converting rubbish values in 'Material_Reference' starting with '00000' to null. Treat reference columns as categorical variables. The 'INDEX' column may not be useful.

Data Preprocessing: Handle missing values using appropriate methods such as mean, median, or mode. Detect and treat outliers using techniques like IQR or Isolation Forest from the sklearn library. Address skewness in the dataset through suitable transformations such as log transformation or boxcox transformation. Encode categorical variables using techniques like one-hot encoding, label encoding, or ordinal encoding.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualize outliers and skewness using Seaborn's boxplot, distplot, and violinplot. Analyze feature relationships and drop highly correlated columns using a heatmap.

Feature Engineering: Engineer new features if applicable, such as aggregating or transforming existing features to create more informative representations of the data.

Model Building and Evaluation: Split the dataset into training and testing/validation sets. Train and evaluate different regression models for 'Selling_Price' prediction and classification models for 'Status' prediction. Utilize appropriate evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and AUC curve. Optimize model hyperparameters using cross-validation and grid search.

Model GUI: Use the Streamlit module to create an interactive web page. Include task input (regression or classification) and input fields for each column value (except 'Selling_Price' for regression and 'Status' for classification). Implement the same preprocessing, scaling, and transformation steps used during model training. Predict the new data from the Streamlit app and display the output.
